# Ambitify database
Ambitify planner database written in Python<br>

This code will be used in the Ambitify planner.
Since it is open source, you can develop your own planner using this code and modify it as well.

# How to use
1. Download the project from GitHub
2. Move the src folder to your project
3. Change the src folder to the database folder
3. Import the database folder into a file and create an object of the Database class

```python
import database


db = database.Database()
```

4. Now you are ready to work with the database

# Changing database settings
By default, the database saves days and tasks along the path folder_where_you_run_the_database/data/schedule.db<br>
If you want to change this, then open the config.py file in the database folder

```python
"""
Database settings
Â© Andboogl, 2024
"""


import os


DATA_TABLE_NAME = 'schedule'
DATABASE_FOLDER_PATH = os.path.join('.', 'data')
DATABASE_FILE_PATH = os.path.join(DATABASE_FOLDER_PATH, 'schedule.db')
```
And you can change the following parameters:<br>
DATABASE_FOLDER_PATH - path to the folder where the database file will be located<br>
DATABASE_FILE_PATH - path to the database file. The folder is pulled automatically<br>
DATA_TABLE_NAME - name of the table in which all data will be stored<br>
